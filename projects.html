     <h1>Projects</h1>
     <h2>=== Finch – News application === <a href="https://github.com/NarmalaSk/Finch">github</a></h2>
     •	Built an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline from source code to production deployment, implementing Docker multi-stage builds, image registry workflows, unit testing, Kubernetes deployments, and automatic scaling using HPA.

<br>•	Established a secure RDS connection using Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, enabling encrypted communication between GKE workloads and the database.
<br>•	Implemented observability using Prometheus and Grafana with custom alerts to track cluster health, performance, and application behavior.

<br>•	Successfully predicted potential production failures and proactively resolved issues using monitoring insights, improving system stability and reliability.

     <h2>=== DocuMind – AI-Powered Document Q&A System === </h2>
      <p>
• Developed a FastAPI-based backend that enables users to upload PDFs or text files, extract
content, and perform intelligent question-answering using OpenAI GPT-4 and LangChain workflows.<br>
• Integrated Pinecone for embedding storage and Supabase for metadata, automating document
ingestion, chunking, and retrieval pipelines, resulting in a 60% improvement in contextual response
accuracy.<br>
• Containerized the backend using Docker and deployed it on Render with GitHub Actions–based
CI/CD for seamless version control and scalability</p>


      <h2>=== VoiceQuery – Voice-Driven Knowledge Assistant === </h2>
      <p>• Built an interactive AI assistant using FastAPI that combines OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text,
GPT-4 for reasoning, and ElevenLabs TTS for generating natural spoken responses.
<br>• Integrated LangChain for contextual prompt flow management and Chroma DB for semantic
vector storage, enabling low-latency conversational retrieval across voice queries.
<br>• Deployed the complete pipeline on Render using Docker and implemented CI workflows for
continuous delivery and version tracking.</p>
